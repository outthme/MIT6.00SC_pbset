1. RectangularRoom
	-represents the tiles which are cleaned
	-keep track of the tile cleaning

2.Robot
	-stores the position and the heading of robots
	-**maybe also stores the speed of the robots

3.position
	-stores the coordinates(x,y) as a position of robots in theroom.


Q1.How to link the communication between Robot and RectangularRoom?

Q2.We need to test whether the new position of func getNewPosition returned
is fitted in the room.
